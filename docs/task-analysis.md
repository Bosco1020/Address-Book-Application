# Address Book Challenge
## Introduction
Recording your contacts on pen and paper if effective, but wouldn’t it be easier to have all your contacts information at your fingertips?  This application aims to provide an environment where you can store and search through all your contacts, maintaining a personal address book with an easy-to-use console interface. 

## The Problems
When your list of contacts grows over the years, maintaining an easy-to-use repository of them can become a hassle.

- **Too Many Contacts?** As you add contacts over the years, maintaining an easy-to-read list of alphabetical names can become a difficult task. Even if you succeed, it can still take several minutes to find the information you need. With the address book, all it takes is a quick search of a contacts name to see a list of every match within your address book, taking only seconds to get that important information.


- **Need Information Fast?** Using the simple commands through the console interface, it takes only a few seconds to get the information needed. Whether you wish to see a list of all contacts in the address book, or search for a specific name, the software can show an orderly list of all their information through a few short commands.


- **Want to Update Details?** People change phone numbers and get new email addresses, but making these changes constantly can ruin a neatly ordered address book. With this digital application, a contacts information can quickly be adjusted however many times necessary. 


## Documented Functionality
Based on the requirements provided by the DFCorp, a set of functionalities have been identified that the software must be able to perform. The software will:
- Hold a record of all the users Contacts and their information,
- Perform logical validation of inputs to reduce accidental errors,
- Provide a console interface for easy interaction and manipulation of the address book data,


## The Software’s Benefits
With these features implemented, the software will be able to function as a convenient address book with a quick and simple interface for the users ease of use:

- With layers of validation embedded within the software, it helps ensure that the user  only enters valid information for a contact. This helps protect against any accidental mis-inputs from the user and provides a layer of protection to ensure nothing goes wrong with the software which could cause it to crash.

- Though the software has no immediate security in place for user verification or data encryption, it has the added benefit of being disconnected from the internet. Unlike other applications that can store information on a contact such as a mobile phone, this software isn’t connected directly to the internet and as such is at a lower risk of being targeted by internet users with malicious intentions of stealing personal data.

- By requiring the user to search for a contact before being able to edit or delete any information, it provides a level of security to ensure no mistakes happen. Inputting the delete or edit commands without first searching for a contact won’t invoke any change in the contacts, helping protect against unwanted alterations. 


## Associated Risks
As with all tools, the software will come with some risks that have been identified below.

- The address book requires no credentials or log-in information to access its contents. Anyone with access to the software could view all the information stored about each of the user’s contacts. This risks exposing sensitive information about the user’s contacts and should be considered when thinking about security of the software.

- The software failing is another risk as the hardware used to run the software is always at risk of power outages, environmental factors, and user mistakes. Any number of reasons can cause the software to fail, including issues outside of the hardware. If this occurs then there’s a risk of data corruption or loss, which can result  in the loss or alteration of contacts information from the address book.


## Impact on Business
In comparison to recording a list of contact information manually, this software provides a convenient service many wish to have access to. The impact on the business could be varied, some of which are discussed below:

- **Glaring Competitors:** In the modern age, most people already have a method of storing vast amount of information on their various contacts. Most phones now record not only the name and phone number of their contacts, but can store their emails, birthdays, addresses and various other pieces of information. In reality this software is redundant in today’s world where everyone has a computer in their pocket already performing these actions. As such, this software wouldn’t provide much if any exposure for the company and most likely be ignored by the wider world.


- **Backlash from Security Concerns:** As described in the risks section, the software currently has no security measures in place to verify the user and control access to the address book. As a result, the information of all a user’s contacts is easily accessible by anyone, and this glaring security fault could be the source of immense backlash from users after installation.


## Conclusion
With its simple and convenient console input design, the software acts as a great way for users to store their personal contacts information on their own machines. However, in the modern age there already exists many other methods of performing the exact same functionality that are far more practical, convenient, and secure.

Expanding upon the core functionality with a user interface, adding security measures and additional functionality that makes the software unique from its competitors may enable it to stand out in an already dense market. In likelihood however, this software holds very little place where almost every mobile phone performs the same functionality out of the box.
